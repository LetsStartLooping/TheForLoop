    <h1> How to assign static IP address to Raspberry Pi? </h1>

    <p>Open the terminal and type following command. This will open the file that contains configuration information for *dhcpd*</p>

    ```shell
    sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
    ```

    <p>Scroll down to the very end of the file and type following for setting up static IP address for ethernet port</p>

    ```bash
    interface eth0
    static ip_address=192.168.1.211/24
    static routers=192.168.1.1
    static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.1
    ```

    <p>Similarly type following for setting up static IP for Wi-fi</p>

```bash
interface wlan0
static ip_address=192.168.1.210/24
static routers=192.168.1.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.1
```

<p>Only difference here is first line starting with word `interface`</p>

`eth0`: Used for LAN

`wlan0`: Used for Wireless Network

<p>Custom UP address should be added on 2nd line just before `/24`</p>
